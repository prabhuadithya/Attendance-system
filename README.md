The following project is a simple implementation of a class attendance system using OpenCV and Excel sheets.

## Built with

To build this project we require the following open source software and libraries.

* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* OpenCV
* An Excel sheet
* A folder containing reference images of students saved with their name

## Step:

* Open Jupyter Notebook
* Paste the following code
* Create a folder with the name 'known_faces' as in the code and save the images of students with their names as file names.
* Create an Excel sheet with the name as in the code.
* Install required libraries from the code using the pip command in the terminal
* Run the code and see the attendance being marked in the Excel sheet with the date and time.

In  this project, I have only  marked attendance by face captured and detected by the camera.
